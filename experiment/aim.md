### Aim of the experiment

This experimentwill introduce students to additive white Gaussian noise. This involves the explanation using animation why the thermal noise generated as a result of the thermal agitation of the electrons inside an electrical conductor at nonzero temperatures.
This experiment is divided into three parts -

1. Thermal noise is additive white Gaussian
2. Autocorrelation and power spectral density of AWGN
3. Additive nature of the noise
