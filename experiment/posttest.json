      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Rn(0) = N0 / 2 for white Gaussian noise autocorrelation. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_white_Gaussian_noise#Autocorrelation_function'>Ref</a>",
        "b": "Incorrect. This is the one-sided PSD, not the autocorrelation value.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Too high.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Rn(τ) is zero for τ ≠ 0, not at τ = 0."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. That’s the unit of the signal, not its autocorrelation.",
        "b": "Incorrect. That’s the unit of PSD.",
        "c": "Correct. Autocorrelation is the expected value of the product of voltage values, hence unit is V². <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrelation'>Reference</a>",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. V_rms = sqrt(P × R) = sqrt(4e-15 × 50) = sqrt(2e-13) ≈ 0.632 μV.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This would be much higher noise power.",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Rn(τ) = 0 for τ ≠ 0 in white noise.",
        "b": "Incorrect. There is no memory; correlation vanishes outside τ = 0.",
        "c": "Correct. AWGN is uncorrelated at non-zero lag, so Rn(τ) = 0 for τ ≠ 0. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_white_Gaussian_noise#Mathematical_description'>See here</a>",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Since Rn(0) = N0/2 = 1×10⁻⁹, then N0 = 2×10⁻⁹. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_spectral_density#Examples'>Reference</a>",
        "b": "Incorrect. That’s the delta coefficient (N0/2).",
