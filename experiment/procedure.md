### Experiment 1: Thermal Noise and the Central Limit Theorem

- Navigate to the **Sub Experiment - 1** tab.
- Click the **Start** button to run the simulation.
- Observe the blue histogram bars conforming to the orange theoretical curve.
- Watch the **Simulated Values** in the Observations panel as they converge toward the **Theoretical Values**.
- Use the **Stop** and **Reset** buttons to control the simulation.
- Adjust the **Number of Electrons (N)** slider and click **Reset** to see its effect.

### Experiment 2: Noise is White

- Navigate to the **Sub Experiment - 2** tab.
- Select the filter strength.
- Observe the scatter plot (also the contours of Gaussian Distribution plotted).
- If they lie exactly horizontally, they are uncorrelated and hence white.
- Also observe the noise signal varriations with the filter strength.

### Experiment 3: BPSK Transmission with AWGN

- Navigate to the **Sub Experiment - 3** tab.
- Enter a binary string (e.g., 101101) into the **Transmit Bitstream** input field.
- Adjust the **Channel Noise Power (σ²)** slider.
- Observe the changes in all four plots as you vary the noise.
- Compare the **Transmitted Bitstream** with the **Decoded Bitstream**.
- Note the errors highlighted in red and read the error count in the **Observations** panel.
