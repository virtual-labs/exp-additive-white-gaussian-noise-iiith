### Experiment 1: Thermal Noise and the Central Limit Theorem

* **N**avigate to the "Sub Experiment - 1" tab.
* Click the "Start" button to run the simulation.
* Observe the blue histogram bars conforming to the orange theoretical curve.
* Watch the "Simulated Values" in the Observations panel as they converge toward the "Theoretical Values".
* Use the "Stop" and "Reset" buttons to control the simulation.
* Adjust the "Number of Electrons (N)" slider and click "Reset" to see its effect.

### Experiment 2: ACF and PSD of White Noise

* Navigate to the "Sub Experiment - 2" tab.
* In the "Autocorrelation Function (ACF)" section, click on the plot you think is correct.
* Click the "Check ACF" button.
* In the "Power Spectral Density (PSD)" section, click on the plot you think is correct.
* Click the "Check PSD" button.
* Read the feedback provided in the observation panels.

### Experiment 3: BPSK Transmission with AWGN

* Navigate to the "Sub Experiment - 3" tab.
* Enter a binary string (e.g., 101101) into the "Transmit Bitstream" input field.
* Adjust the "Channel Noise Power (σ²)" slider.
* Observe the changes in all four plots as you vary the noise.
* Compare the "Transmitted Bitstream" with the "Decoded Bitstream".
* Note the errors highlighted in red and read the error count in the "Observations" panel.
